* Code
** Game
*** TODO generalize animations
Game should have a list of a list of animations which recieve a tick
(which may or may not cause them to change their state).  animations
should be able to remove themselves from the animation list.

Implement as a mixin?



*** TODO better levels
A level should be a directed graph of rooms.  (room should still be a
struct containing a vector for tile info

*** TODO implement hooks (started on this but didn't follow through).

*** Possible changes
  - Figure out how to do the screens better, should they really be
    able to perform arbitrary changes on the games state?
  - Rewrite tile.rkt to be class-based?

** Gui
*** TODO Text support
Requires me drawing up some fonts.  One large (like current GAME OVER
font), one small (for dialogues, etc).

** General
*** NEXT configurable settings
   - Use dynamic parameters?

* Art
** TODO Two font sets

* Sound
